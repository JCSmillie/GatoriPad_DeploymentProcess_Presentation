# GatoriPad_DeploymentProcess_Presentation
Slides and example scripts from presentation given at Gateway High School to other IT folks from local districts about how we deploy our iPads with Mosyle and various custom scripts.  This presentation was given at the "Apple Round table Discussion for local Districts" hosted by Gateway School District on March 10th, 2022.

The slides from the Keynote will be posted AFTER the presentation (same day.)  This is because there are a few things we tweaked right up to the minute before we presented!
